Pong Game 
Created By: Suthery Sok

I created a Pong game that allows the user to compete against AI. I utilized Canvas to help build my background.

If trying to use the game, use either the Github.io page linked within the GitHub page or to install in VS code please have the Live Server extension properly open a webpage within VS code.


Unsolved Problems/ Ideas :
Wanted to add a better-looking display for the pong game for the users to see.
Wanted to add a level of difficulty to the AI making it harder or easier.
