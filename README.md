Pong Game 
Created By: Suthery Sok

I created a Pong game that allows the user to compete against AI. I utilized Canvas to help build my background.

If trying to use the game, use either the Github.io page linked within the GitHub page or to install in VS code please have the Live Server extension properly open a webpage within VS code.


Unsolved Problems/ Unsuccessful Ambitions:
Created a Winner Screen with a score to showcase the player to win,
  The problem occurred that it didn't create a new canvas to display the winning screen
  It also introduced a bug that didn't allow the user to create a new game.
